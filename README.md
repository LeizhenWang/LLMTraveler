### Route Choice Modeling Using LLM-based Agent
This repository contains the code for the paper exploring the use of Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents in route choice modeling.
If you are interested in the methodology and results of this project, please refer to our paper:
[AI-Driven Day-to-Day Route Choice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03338)

### Coming Soon
The full code will be released after the review process is completed.
